### About the Apps

#### functions

#### Interface
* It is relatively comfusing to adjust interface display as MDL has a lot of `css` classes. 
* And to fit the same content on different size of device are not easy. As so, the user guide in `HELP` button needs more work digging into proper `css` style.
### About server and database
* Without Database quesry support, the comparing or filtering iis more complex without constraint check
* As Node.js Express Framework use `app.use(express.static(__dirname));` allow us get static file 
on ubuntu server. The AJAX action are easier achievedÂ
